# Cypress E2E Catalog Testing – Practice Software Testing

This repository contains an End-to-End (E2E) automation suite focused on testing the **Browse Products** functionality of the [Practice Software Testing application](https://practicesoftwaretesting.com/). It uses Cypress and follows the **Page Object Model** structure for clarity and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Maintains separation between UI elements and test logic, with reusable components for the sidebar, grid, pagination, and navbar.
- **Centralized test data:** Multi-scenario test inputs are managed in test-data.js, enabling forEach iteration over data sets for cases like price slider scenarios, sort options, filter combinations, and pagination scenarios.
- **Comprehensive catalog coverage:** Validates product display, sorting, filtering, price range slider, pagination, and category navigation.
- **Mochawesome HTML Reports:** An HTML report is automatically generated in the /cypress/reports folder after each test run, providing a visual summary of passed and failed tests.
